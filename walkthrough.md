# Play Store Preparation Complete 🎉

Your app is now technically ready for the Play Store!

## 📂 Deliverables

### 1. App Bundle (File to Upload)
**File**: `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
**Description**: This is the file you upload to Google Play Console. It is signed with your new keystore.

### 2. Keystore (Keep Safe!)
**File**: `release-keystore.jks` (in project root)
**Password**: `sg2026!`
**Alias**: `upload`
> [!WARNING]
> Save this file and password in a safe place (Google Drive, Password Manager). If you lose this, you cannot update your app on the Play Store later.

### 3. Graphics
- **Icon**: You have a custom icon (`logo3`).
- **Feature Graphic**: You still need to create this (1024x500).
- **Screenshots**: Take screenshots from your phone.
